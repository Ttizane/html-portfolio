<h1>The Best Movies According to Riccardo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>The movie Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten an Oscar for. His portrayal of the character is perfect. The movie is well-written, leaving no details out of the original story.</p>
<h3>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</h3>
<p>This seemingly pointless celebration of bad behavior is also a hilarious and crazily visual comedy for adults</p>
<h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
<p>Quite rightly regarded as one of the best films of all time, TAXI DRIVER is without a doubt compelling viewing. What the film lacks in plot it makes up for in characterisation.</p>
